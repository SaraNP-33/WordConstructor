# Animal Node Hangman

This back-end application is a hangman game using Node, inquirer and Construstors to create the game.

## Sample Images
 
 To initialize the game the user would type node index and would be prompted with a question using inquirer to start the game. 
 If the user says no then a message would pop up exiting the game. But if the user says yes we can see the result in the image below.
